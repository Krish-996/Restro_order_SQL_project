# Restro_order_SQL_project
In this SQL  project i analyzed a 3 months data of a restaurant.

I got this dataset from maven analytics , it contains 3 months data of a restraunt orders.
it has two tables one is menu_details and other is order_details.

I performed some very basic and beginner friendly analysis in this project in three parts:
1) menu table analysis
  --View the menu table
  --find the number of items on the menu
  --what are the least and most expensive items on the menu
  --how many italian dishes are on the menu
  --what are the most and least expensive italian dishes on the menu
  --how many dishes are in each category
  --what is the average dish price in each category
  
2) order table analysis
   --view the order table
   --what is the date range of the table
   --how many orders were made in this range
   --how many items were ordered in this range
   --which orders had the most number of items
   --how many orders had more than 12 items
   
3) combined analysis
   --combine the menu_items and order_details table into single tables
   --what are the least and most ordered items ? what categories are they in ?
   --what are the top 5 orders spent the most money ?
   --view the details of highest spend order
   --View the details of 5 highest spent orders .

The aim for this project is to understand the behaviour of customers towards our menu and performances of our menu items / dishes.
